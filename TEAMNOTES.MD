September 23rd
Today we made some very large changes to our button. Prior to to day we had numerous problems with even gettin gour boilerplate wokring.  Today we got that figured out and watched a live demo in class.  We took the information that we gained in class to get our icon working on our button.  We also got our button live and wokring so that clicking on the button will bring the user to the correct website.  We also got the hover state working so that the user can hold the cursor over the button and it will changes brightnesses. Now our next step is bringing in some new states for our button.
