September 23rd
Today we made some very large changes to our button. Prior to to day we had numerous problems with even gettin gour boilerplate wokring.  Today we got that figured out and watched a live demo in class.  We took the information that we gained in class to get our icon working on our button.  We also got our button live and wokring so that clicking on the button will bring the user to the correct website.  We also got the hover state working so that the user can hold the cursor over the button and it will changes brightnesses. Now our next step is bringing in some new states for our button. 


In-class activity - September 28th
The group that we paired with were working on a Penn State Hockey button.  It looked great.  We both utlized the hover feature within our code.  Our goes to transparent when we hover over our button. We also both obviously utilized an icon feature within the button.  We did have different icons as we have the save icon within our button.  Two things that are different is that they use the invert feature to change the color within their button.  They also open to a new window when they click on their button. Our button currently opens the link on the same page. Something we plan on leveraging from this session is using the invert feature to change the color on our button.  The code is below: 

host([invert]) .ctaButton:focus {
        --psu-foreground-color: #003087;
        --psu-background-color: white;
      }
      
 September 30th 
 Today we worked on actually publishing our button to npm.  We were successful in doing so. We made an organization on npm to replicate our organization on GitHub then Andrew was able to successfully publish our button to that organization.  We also worked out a few bugs including our button openning multiple windows when we click on the button.  We got all of our states figured out and our focus state working correctly. We added in a disabled feature for one of the three buttons.  We then learned how to add all of our information in the storybook.
 
 
 October 3rd
 Today we just went through and double checked everything.  We tested the buttonsn functionality out and it checked out.  We did have to do some more work though for adding information into the StorybookJS doc. We were sort of confused on this task at first but then soon figured it all out. We then finished by posting our link to the button that we posted on npm.
